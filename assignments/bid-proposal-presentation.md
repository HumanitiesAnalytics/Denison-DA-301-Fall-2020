# Bid Proposal Presentation

This presentation is a team assignment worth 5% of your overall course grade. These in-class presentations will be evaluated roughly following the rubric at the end of this assignment description. Since this is your first evaluated presentation in the course, the grade weighting and evaluation is based more on content and materials and less on the actual delivery (though that matters). The delivery is expected to improve as you reflect on this early experience and continue to grow your skills moving toward future presentations. 

At some point in the days after the presentation (one week maximum) you will present and meet with your client. While the content may vary a bit since the client is a different audience, I will be seeking some feedback from them as to how these bid meetings went (see last couple lines of rubric).

## Some General Advice

- All members of the team should participate in the presentation for roughly equivalent
amounts of time.
- This should go without saying, you should not read from a sheet of paper. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you should not read from a fully written out text.

- Length in lass should be 10-15 minutes, but it will be useful to aim for 10-12 minutes in case you go over. Your client meeting should be for 30-60 minutes with a 10-15 minute presentation being part of that meeting. Of course, depending on what your client wants.
- A general rule of thumb is 1 slide per minute of presentation, so maybe 12 slides
- Think of your slides as visual aides. Do not try to include all information on your slides
- Presentation slides should include significant concepts, key points, terminology with definitions, and other important pieces of information
- The bulleted list is generally overused in slide presentations. Include memorable images, charts, graphs, etc. Give proper credit to things you did not create. 
- For the in-class version, you will probably spend a bit more time on the overview of the puzzle
and your interpretation since the audience is less familiar than clients.
- Make sure to project/enunciate and speak with confidence
- Think about transitions and who will do what in advance of your presentation
- Be prepared to answer questions after the presentation and be prepared to ask questions of other teams
- Regardless of whether it made it in the bid-proposal try to spend some time getting specific (without being overly technical) about the methodology, stats, models, etc. ... This is usually what the clients want to see and will help you get the most from the conversation in terms of new ideas.

## Assessment

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Clarity | The presentation had a clear organization, and was easy to follow across the different presenters and sections.|
| Oral presentation | Each presenter spoke clearly and loudly enough to be heard and understood |

| Client-Team interaction | Feedback from your client suggests that the meeting was professionally conducted and that they were satisfied with your interaction and written/oral presentation of the bid.|
| Client-Team plan | Feedback from your client suggests that they were satisfied with your preparation, domain research and plan of approach.
