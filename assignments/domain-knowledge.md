# Domain-knowledge Assignment

This assignment is due not later than 1:49 pm on Monday, September 7th. Turn it in by adding it to your individual Google Drive folder for this class. The project is meant to be a mini-review of a sub-topic related to your client's field or project, to help each team member build domain-knowledge.

## Scope

A sub-topic needed to understand your team’s project and to help plan your approach, but each team member should tackle a different area. Thus, no two team member’s papers will be the same. For example, for clients asking for an analysis of dairy production, one member might research and write about how the dairy industry or economic market has changed in the past 10 years, one might look into the biochemistry of cheese production, and another might focus on modern data or statistical tools common to that industry.

Your mini-review is a coherent essay of a literature review, related to the topic or client’s problem, followed by an explanation of how your data analysis is informed by, or grows out of that review. In other words, show how you identify the focus of your team’s data analysis in terms of what is already known about the subject, or a demonstrated need or gap in knowledge. The purpose of the literature review is to know what others have discovered before you begin your investigation of your own, to ground your analysis.

The purpose of this assignment is to research a topic for analysis so you can learn to:

(1) identify and formulate an inquiry question that defines what you’d like to learn,
(2) search, locate, and assess information using library and Internet resources,
(3) synthesize new knowledge into a written literature review, and
(4) establish context and confidence from your client in your ability to speak knowledgeably on
the topic.

## Format 

You may choose to write about your topic in a simple series of paragraphs, or you may want to divide it into logical sections (with headers) based on the nature of the topic or process you are describing.

Each mini-review should be a concise review of the subject and 3-5 pages (not counting references or any visuals you choose to include), with a minimum of 5-7 citations, with 5 of them being unique (i.e., not cited by another teammate). Visuals are not required, but if you include any, they must be properly cited to source, and have captions to explain them. Text should be 1.5 spaced and written in a standard font (e.g. Times New Roman 11 or 12 point size) with standard 1 inch margins all around. 

## References

All information must be cited properly using parenthetical style (First Author, Year) in the text, and the full citation in APA format in the References section at the end of the review. References could include primary or secondary literature, reputable blogs or websites, podcasts, personal interviews, etc. Remember to use page numbers in parentheticals if appropriate to the citation (i.e., quoting or narrow paraphrase).
