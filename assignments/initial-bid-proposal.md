# Initial Bid Proposal 

In the simplest sense, a proposal is a plan of action for addressing a need. It is a specific genre in professional writing, which strives to be honest, evidence-based, specific, and detailed. Bid proposals typically include information about the company amking the bid, the work to be performed, anticipated costs, a timeline of work to be done, a list of subcontractors to be included, and anything asked for in the RFP. Our proposals will be a little bit different since we are writing them for clients and for this class, but we will stay fairly close to a standard template.

This is the first major team benchmark and the first formal deliverable to the client. Though you have already been hired, here we want to imagine your team is competing for this contract (so at least we can say you’ve earned the job!). This is your chance to demonstrate to the client that you are knowledgeable about the subject matter. This is a team assignment worth 10% of your overall course grade. It should be submitted to the professor and to your client no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, September 11th.

## Section Descriptions

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cover Page Team name 	| any log/branding etc. ... you want to try out at this stage, visually appealing, names and contact info for all team members. |
| Problem/Opportunity Statement 	| A few paragraphs stating the main problem or opportunity your client wishes you to address. This should clearly demonstrate to the client that you’re knowledgeable about the subject matter by using your early domain-knowledge research to briefly review the subject matter and background.|
| Key Stakeholders 		| Who is affected by the project? Who benefits from the outcomes of the project? Who will need to play a role in helping ensure the project is completed? |
| Deliverables 		| What anticipated item(s) will you deliver to to the client by the end of the semester? |
| Success Criteria 		| How will you know that your project has been success? How will you determine if your deliverables are any "good"? What milestones will you use during the course of the project to determine that you are "on track" to achieving your goals? |
| Main Approach 	| This is the main body of the project bid, with details explaining your general plan for problem-solving, proposing your analytical approach, and your timeline for working through tasks. In this section, you may also want to make clear any assumptions, constraints, or risks that could affect your project. | Ideally some insight into your eventual methodology, possible modeling strategies, etc… would be included here. Give them a sense of how you will get to the promised insights. However, remember the audience and frame this appropriately to their expertise.|
| Visual | Your timeline should be depicted visually. You may choose the format you feel is most effective (e.g., table, gantt chart, PERT, flowchart).|
| Provisions 	| What do you need to conduct the work? In a real project bid, this section would include a budget, but you may want to focus on any tools you will need (hardware, software), special permissions (licensing, university clearance), meetings with key personnel, and/or references that you will use to familiarize yourself with the subject or analytical approach.|
| Conclusion 	| 1 paragraph summary that also hits on why your team should be hired.|
| References 	| Cite your sources, using standard parenthetical style citations in the text, and a references section consistent with APA (Author, Year)|
| Appendices, including Individual Resumes| You may have additional appendices that might discuss things in more detail that would derail the flow of the main document. One Appendix (Call it appendix A so you can refer to it in the main text) should be reserved for Team Qualifications: Resumes where each team member’s professional resume* should be appended to the end of the project bid document.|

## Formatting Norms 

- Bid proposals should be 1.15 (standard Google doc spacing), 1.5, or double-spaced and use a standard font (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri) and size (11 or 12). 
- Length: 5+ pages (probably on the longer side of this depending on formatting choices and you may go over a bit as long as it is sharp and objectively essential), not counting resumes, references, or any visuals.
- Bid proposals should use at least one visual aid (e.g. table, flowchart, etc.) to demonstrate the timeline with proposed tasks and deliverables. 
- You should have a cover page with your team name, any branding you’d like to try out, and team member names/contact info. 
- Your project bid is not expected to contain visual aids other than the timeline, but you are strongly encouraged to include 1-2 preliminary graphs, photos, flowcharts, or other graphics if they clearly help to demonstrate your main approach (e.g. mapping a process or showing an image of the data or tool that demonstrates what you will change/analyze/build). Remember the value of prototyping.
