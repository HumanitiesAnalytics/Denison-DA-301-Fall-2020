In the simplest sense, a proposal is a plan of action for addressing a need. It is a specific genre in professional writing, which strives to be honest, evidence-based, specific, and detailed. Bid proposals typically include information about the company amking the bid, the work to be performed, anticipated costs, a timeline of work to be done, a list of subcontractors to be included, and anything asked for in the RFP. Our proposals will be a little bit different since we are writing them for clients and for this class, but we will stay fairly close to a standard template.
