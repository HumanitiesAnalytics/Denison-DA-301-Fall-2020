## Tips for Success

- Talk to the class when you present; don't just read from a sheet of paper. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you may not read from a fully written out text.
- Think of your slides as visual aides. Do not try to include all information on your slides
- Your slides should cite sources, and you should include an extra slide with a works cited page (that doesn't play for 20 seconds)
- Presentation slides should include significant concepts, key points, terminology with definitions, and other important pieces of information
- They might also include quotations from your primary and/secondary sources, with explanations of their significance
- At least a third of your slides should include memorable images, charts, graphs, etc.

## What to Turn In

Before the day you are giving your presentation, save a copy of your slides to your Google Drive folder and verify that the folder is shared it with me. Google Slides, PowerPoint, or PDF formats are acceptable. Include your notes for each slide, either in the slide notes section or in a separate document.
