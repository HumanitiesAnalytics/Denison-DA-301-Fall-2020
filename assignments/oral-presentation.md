# Ignite Presentation

This is an individual assignment worth 5% of your overall course grade and is a key way to evaluate your individual "R-overlay" growth building on the ungraded early team, visualization, and other opportunities to practice. Each student will also contribute to peer review of one or more talks, and to participate in thoughtful questions and discussion of the talks as a whole. The assignment is meant to expose you to a different type of communication, and to help you gain confidence and practice communicating. This semester, because of covid-19, we will be recording our talks and sharing them via notebowl. 

A PechaKucha is type of lightning talk where a presenter shows 20 slides for 20 seconds of commentary each (6 minutes and 40 seconds total). The idea of this format to is constrain the presentation with a time limit and to press the presenter to convey information in an economical, accessible way. When first doing presentations in this style, students are often struck by how awkward it can be to have their slides advance automatically beofre they have finished speaking, or to finish speaking early and have to wait for the slide to advance. However, this is indeed the point of the format: to call your attention to the process of planning out each slide's content so that your presentation goes smoothly. 

## Due Date 

Your video submissions will be due by classtime on Monday, November 9. Note that our initial calendar called for hal the presentations to take place Monday, November 2, but this is no longer the case. 

## Your Topic

You are free to choose a topic for your presentation, as long as it is related to your project or to data analytics more broadly. For example, you might present on something interesting related to your client’s field and your data analysis. Similarly, you could give a talk describing your project’s dataset and some interesting/problematic features of it. Or maybe you recently came across a cool new analytical approach, code function, or project management tool, and you want to share it with your classmates. The key is to make it exciting - this is often completely separate from the topic domain!

## Advancing Slides Automatically 

The easiest way to program a slide show to advance every 20 seconds is probably to use Google Slides and follow these instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I65a-sYHdQ However, you may use any program you prefer, as long as you accomplish the goal of having each slide display forr exactly 20 seconds. 

## Recording your Presentation and Turning in Your Work

There are a variety of screen capture/recording options you can use to record yourself presenting your PechKucha. It is your responsibility to research possible tools, establish enough comptency to make a video, and and record your presentation. That said, OBS is free, cross-platform compatible, and relatively easy to use. (See https://obsproject.com/) Save or export your video in mpeg format and submit it via the NoteBowl assignment stub. 

## Peer Review 

Once all video files are submitted, I will make everyone's presentations available via Notebowl. You are expected to watch all 12 talks, which will take 1.5 to 2 hours (coutning transition time), so please plan accordingly. Each student will be responsible for providing written feedback to one peer by the time of the following class. Since presentations are short, you will only need to provide peer feedback in one of the areas listed below. (I will assign which talk each person reviews, so that everyone writes and receives one review). These questions are designed to make you look for certain elements in the presentation, think about whether they worked, and to make suggestions.

Remember that strong critical feedback is about being positive, specific, & providing a next step.

1. Summarize the main argument or storyline of the talk in one sentence. If you had difficulty doing this, why do you think that was? Was the talk too general? Unfocused? What would have made the talk more effective? If this was easy to do, what specifically did the presenter do that made it easy to identify the main point?

2. Did the presenter engage your attention? What specifically did they do (speak, body language, show) that kept your attention during the presentation? Did they do anything that detracted from the presentation? What could the presenter do next time to connect
to the audience better?

3. Jot down 2-3 questions that you had during the talk, or that remained after the talk. Are these questions that came up because you were engaged in the talk and are interested in having a longer conversation? Or are these questions that came to mind because you
felt confused, or because parts of the talk felt unfinished or lacking in description?

4. Summarize the main "take home" message of the presentation in one sentence. What does the presenter want you to know, do, or think about differently after seeing their talk? If you had difficulty doing this, why do you think that was? Was the talk too general? Unfocused? What would have made the talk more effective? If this was easy to do, what specifically did the presenter do that made it easy to identify the main point?

5. Jot down the evidence (visual, verbal, citations, or examples) used to support the main point or the main claims made in the presentation. Did the evidence support the main message of the talk? Did you find it convincing? Would you suggest other claims or
evidence to support or contradict the main message?

## Grading Rubric

### Clarity: 

The presentation had a clear organization with a clear main story and a take home message.

### Knowledge: 

Demonstrated an understanding of the subject, critical thinking skills, & made clear connections to a "big picture" context.

### Use of Language and Examples: 

Helped others to understand the material, by using plain language and examples/explanations that a listener unfamiliar with your dataset or subject could understand. 

### Time Management: 

Presentation followed the 20x20 format, with automatically advancing slides. In general, the verbal presentation
kept pace with the visual presentation of the slides. 

### Oral Presentation: 

Presenter spoke clearly and loudly enough to be heard and understood.

### Visual Presentation: 

Visual aids (graphs, charts, photos, etc) helped increase engagement and understanding of the subject matter and project approach. 

### Peer Feedback: 

Participated in providing feedback on peer presentations, and demonstrated careful attention to other students' work.

### Proper Citations

Used multiple reliable sources. Information included in slides was credited to its proper source. A "works cited" slide at the end of the presentation gave full bibliographical information for all works cited on slides. 

## A Few Tips for Success

- Talk to the class when you present; don't just read from a sheet of paper. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you may not read from a fully written out text.
- Think of your slides as visual aides. Do not try to include all information on your slides
- Your slides should cite sources, and you should include an extra slide with a works cited page (that doesn't play for 20 seconds)
- Presentation slides should include significant concepts, key points, terminology with definitions, and other important pieces of information
- They might also include quotations from your primary and/secondary sources, with explanations of their significance
- At least a third of your slides should include memorable images, charts, graphs, etc.
