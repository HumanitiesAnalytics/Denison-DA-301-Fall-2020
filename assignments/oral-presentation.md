# Oral Presentation

Each of you will be responsible for giving a PechaKucha presentation this semester. A PechaKucha is type of lightning talk where a presenter shows 20 slides for 20 seconds of commentary each (6 minutes and 40 seconds total). The idea of this format to is constrain the presentation with a time limit and to press the presenter to convey information in an economical, accessible way. For your topic and date, you should use the provided sign-up sheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AoyHB3wTL7kwEUPZ1HZxXqwMSEZ_Nxpbr7Evw08Pm4/edit?usp=sharing. Each topic is designed to connect to the material we will be discussing that day in class.

## Tips for Success

- Talk to the class when you present; don't just read from a sheet of paper. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you may not read from a fully written out text.
- Think of your slides as visual aides. Do not try to include all information on your slides
- Your slides should cite sources, and you should include an extra slide with a works cited page (that doesn't play for 20 seconds)
- Presentation slides should include significant concepts, key points, terminology with definitions, and other important pieces of information
- They might also include quotations from your primary and/secondary sources, with explanations of their significance
- At least a third of your slides should include memorable images, charts, graphs, etc.

## What to Turn In

Save a copy of your slides to your Google Drive folder and verify that the folder is shared it with me. Google Slides, PowerPoint, or PDF formats are acceptable. Include your notes for each slide, either in the slide notes section or in a separate document.

## Grading

I will not use the primary rubric for these presentations, as they are meant to be a low pressure assignment. Instead, I will grade on a check, check-plus, check-minus scale. I reserve the right to give harsher grades to students who simply don't do the required work or seem to be blowing off the assignment.
