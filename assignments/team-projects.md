# Project Final Packet 

## Includes Executive Summary, Technical Report, Products, Presentation & Debrief

This is a team assignment worth 30% of your overall course grade, comprised of written and verbal components. The written and electronic component is worth 20% of your course grade and should be submitted to the professor and to your client no later than 5 pm on Friday, November 20. Language should be professional, plain, and simple - persuasive but not emotional. Brevity, clarity, and readability are the goals. Do not be dull, if you can avoid it. The written documents should be 1.15 or 1.5 spaced, as in previous reports.

The written report will be followed up by a formal presentation, assessment, and debriefing of your data analysis (over Zoom) with your client in the pre-scheduled time during exam week, and it counts as another 10% toward your final grade. Your team will also need to a visual supplement for the Zoom presentation (see more details later in this packet).

The composition and presentation of the final report has been building all semester and scaffolded through many individual and team assignments: the bid, domain knowledge, progress reports, presentation practice, in class workshops, visualization, etc. Thus the formal written deliverables and subsequent presentation represent a culmination of all the work and skills that you have been building all semester! Show off what you know, make sure it is polished, thorough, complete, and balances technical knowledge with clear (ABC) presentation appropriate to the audience. Don't just make assumptions; flesh them out.

Below, you can find the section that will be included in the final packet that you will deliver to your client and professor, and their weighting towards the overall final grade: 

## Executive Summary

The high-level, but concrete, summary of what you accomplished (and what, if anything, remains to be done or wasn't finished) and what final recommendations and products you have produced for the client use. 1-2 pages, 5% of grade.

## Technical Report

This is the main body of the report, and contains the technical details of what you did and used to prepare the analysis and how to interpret the results. It should contain details on your data, computational tools, statistical results, visual graphics, and interpretation. It should include at least (probably more) two fully and accurately interpreted statistical tests that support the main findings/recommendations, and at least three polished, professional visuals. 10-15 pages, 15% of grade. ([Example here](https://rsph.anu.edu.au/files/Experience-based-full-report.pdf); [some tips here](https://www.writing-skills.com/report-writing-for-consultants).)

## Products 

These are the actual product(s) that you created for the user. Depending on the request, it may be a cleaned dataset, a newly designed database or data entry system, a set of recommendations for future or continuing data/analysis, and/or a computational tool for the user to conduct their own calculations or analysis. The tools should be polished and presented along with clear instructions explaining them and how they are to be stored, accessed, maintained, and used. 1-3 pages + electronic links or copies of data or software products, 5% of grade.

## Presentation and Debrief

Formal presentation to your client. This will be a 30 minute time slot for you to summarize to your client,  verbally and visually, what you found and what your end products and recommendations are. The client and instructors will discuss your results briefly, and then meet with both teams together (a second 30 minute time slot) for a final debriefing and comparison of the results. 60 minutes total, 10% of grade.

## The Final Report and Presentation

Through the semester, your teams practiced the Data Analytics Cycle -- question → data wrangling → data analysis/modeling → communication -- to provide your client's deliverables. The "Final" is your last opportunity to communicate and "sell" to your client what you've accomplished over the semester. You should continue to use a writing format and editing process that achieves Accurate, Brief, and Clear writing. You can and should also continue to use visual elements in your text (e.g. clear headings, breaks between paragraphs, use of bullets, numbering, and captions, bold or italics) and in presenting your data (graphics, tables, etc.).

We can best engage the client by making sure the information they need to process is easy for them to digest and understand. One method is to use the 1-3-25 model (visual aid, executive summary, full report). What this does is help put all the interesting and important information up front, and keep the nitty-gritty details (and the technical bits that are more for your professor than for your client) to the end. This way, if your client is busy and they only have time to carefully read the Executive Summary and the Visual Aid (during the presentation), they will still have a strong understanding of your project deliverables and recommendations. 

Finally, you will need to submit electronic files (or physical), as agreed upon for your project. 

## Visual Supplement for the Zoom Presentation 

- You should display this over Zoom as part of your presentation
- The format is completely up to you, but two obvious options are slides or a digital poster

## 1-2 page Executive Summary 

## 10-15 page Technical Report

- for a larger project, 25 pages might be standard, but we'll aim for 10-15
- At least 2 fully and accurately interpreted statistical tests that support the main findings or recommendations
- At least 3 polished and professionally prepared visuals

## Products (Supporting Files and or Links)
-  You may provide these in one zipped folder, especially if it contains some larger files. It should be well organized and file names should be clear and easy to understand from your README.
- These may include, but are not limited to:
	- Code, GitHub repository, program, GUI, interactive dashboard, dataset(s), tutorial(s), etc.
	- It is strongly recommended that any datasets you provide to the client have a metadata sheet that accompanies them.
	- It is strongly recommended that any code, program, GUI, or dashboard you provide have some sort of tutorial (e.g., handout, program, video, training session) that accompanies it.

Below are some recommendations on what would be included in each of these sections. I also strongly encourage you to start writing early, and seek out second opinions or feedback on your format and writing before the final deadline.

## The title page, executive summary, and technical report 

- Should be handed in as one merged pdf file.
- Same format and expectations as for previous reports

## Executive Summary (1-2 pages)

- Should be sufficient for a busy client/executive to read and understand
- Signals the findings and recommendations of the entire report, so the technical writing can be read with the conclusions in mind
- Should be visually appealing and use visual elements (headings, bullets, etc.) to break up sections of the text, and highlight the main story.
- You should use headings

### Suggested sections should communicate or summarize:

- Restates the original problem statement, or question to be answered
- Key findings summarized
- Summary figure with caption
- Recommendations
- Summary of the methods of analysis
- Outlines any limitations of the report/analysis, or caveats for interpretation/use
- Provides next steps for future investigation

## Technical Report (10-15 pages, including visuals and references)

- This part might look and feel similar to the information contained in an academic journal article. That's because this is the cumulative knowledge that you've gained this semester, and the new work and insights that you've achieved.
- This is the "meat" of the report. Parts of this may feel repetitive, and it should include information that you have written in the executive summary and/or in your previous reports (project bid, progress reports).
- This is a good thing! It means you should not be starting from scratch , and that you already have a lot of previously written text you can draw on. The trick is to knit it all together into a cohesive document, that conveys the final key message.
- Remember, that although this is a class assignment and there are things that your professor is requiring you to include, you are writing this for the client.
- Use headings liberally throughout your report. Each report may have slightly different headings, but sections should contain the information listed (though you may come up with your own specific headings or sub-headings to use).

## Expected Sections (with Headings) Are:

### Background/Problem Statement and Scope (1-2 paragraphs)

- What was the purpose of the project? What issues should it address?
- What was the scope of the work *your team* did? What did it exclude/include from the overall purpose, or big-picture?
- State any agreed upon assumptions that were relevant to using the data and/or conducting the analyses.
- Personnel (1 paragraph, possibly a table?)
- Who were the members of the project team? What were the main tasks/skills that each member contributed to (e.g. author contributions)? What other people should be acknowledged as contributing to the project?

### Ethical Considerations (1 short paragraph)
- What ethical considerations did the project take into account? Hint: all projects have ethical considerations.

### Literature Review (1-2 paragraphs)

- Summarize the literature review, interviews, etc. that helped provide the domain knowledge for the project, and guide your understanding of the subject matter, data use, and/or methodology.
- Use proper citations throughout this section, and possibly other sections, where relevant (at least 5).

### Methodology (2-4 paragraphs?)

This section should contain information addressing the following:

- How did the team carry out its work?
- What tools or software did the team use?
- How did the team collaborate or communicate on technical data analysis aspects of the project (e.g. GitHub, Google Drive, email...)

Describe your:

- Datasets, data cleaning, decisions to include/exclude data
- What summary statistics did you calculate, on which variables. What was the goal of calculating each of these.
- Statistical analyses. How did you choose each analysis, what question(s) did each analysis answer, and what variables did you input to the analysis?
- If visuals (graphics, tables) are useful to describe your methods or your thought process, you may include them here.

### Findings (2-4 paragraphs?)

- Summarize the results of your summary statistics and statistical analyses.
- Fully report statistical output for each analysis or model (e.g., for a linear regression, this means R2, P-value, and slope estimate) in the text, or in a nicely formatted table.
- Use graphics to summarize your results and highlight your key points. Graphics should be polished and professional.
- ( optional ) You may link to interactive graphics that are stored online if you would like, but the report must contain graphics that stand alone and look good in the document.

### Recommendations (1-2 paragraphs?)

- The more detailed and developed your recommendations are, and the better the report will be, and the more it will help the client!
- Lay out several suggested courses of actions, with priorities and (estimated) costs (time and/or money)
- Visuals may be included as needed or useful
- What can/should the client do or say, now that they have the results of your analysis?
- How do you recommend they proceed going forward?
- How can they continue to use your products in the future?

### Conclusion (1-2 paragraphs?)

A final summary of your work, and the recommendations and value that you have provided. This section may also include:

- Next Steps: what further analyses should be done? Data collected? What else needs to happen in order to implement your recommendations? How could these recommendations impact the department or your client in the future?
- Dissenting views: (only if there were collaborators/clients with disagreements to the findings and recommendations, and you feel that these are important to show or consider, rare to include).

### Deliverables and Supporting Materials (0.5 pages - 1 page)

- This could be a list or a table of the accompanying products that you have completed for the client.
- Accompanying text may make recommendations for storage, access, maintenance, use, and/or links to the items (for example, software, tools, equations, dataset(s), dashboards, GitHub repo, etc.)

### References

- APA, or equivalent format. List all references that support the background and literature review for the project, or that support the methods, visuals, and/or interpretation of the results (& cite them in the text). Year of publication in parentheses after all in-text references.

### Appendix

- As before, an appendix is up to each team. It is not for main figures. These should be in the text near where they are discussed.
- This is for supporting graphics, expanded methods details, surveys, and/or material that helps to support the methods, results, or recommendations, but is not the "main" story that you wish the client to see. It is "extra".

### Visual Supplement and Presentation 

- The material should communicate the most important things you want your client to know or walk away with after the project and after your presentation.
- It would be wise to indicate  what the original "problem statement" was that you were "hired" to address.
- I strongly recommend the visual aid have a section for "Recommendation" or "Key Messages" and contain at least one visual.
- It should probably also have a brief "birds-eye view" summary of your data, methods, and analyses.
- Your presentation is recommended to be 10-15 minutes, so you have plenty of time to discuss or have Q&A with your clients. You might also use some of this time to show or walk them through some data, results, or tools that you have created.
- You are expected to dress and behave professionally at this meeting. Look the part! :)

## Grading Rubric 

### Executive Summary (+ Title Page; 5%)

Use a similar format as for progress reports, but include more detail and a visual to understand the project as a whole. Ask for feedback or clarification early!

| Rating | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| A, Exceptional | Title page is visually appealing and professionally prepared. It contains identifying text, including, but not limited to, client name, project name, team name, etc. In other words, it is clear what the document is, from the cover page. It does not look like a "school assignment" and is not overcrowded. For the Executive Summary, text, bullet points, and/or graphics all fit neatly onto 1-2 pages without overcrowding, or wasted white space. Formatting and font look professional, and is not a "wall of text" or simply bullet points with no organization. The key message(s) and recommendations are clearly presented to the client, up front. These should be clear and specific, and in sufficient detail to describe the process undertaken and how your success was measured. Sections of the Executive Summary should also: restate the original problem statement or question, summarize methods and approach, and provide next steps or use case scenarios. At least one polished visual is included that summarizes a key message, and has a clear and informative caption.|
| B, Satisfactory | Title page is professionally prepared. It contains identifying text, including, but not limited to, client name, project name, team name, etc. It does not look like a "school assignment" and is not overcrowded. For the Executive Summary, text, bullet points, and/or graphics all fit neatly onto 1-2 pages without overcrowding, or wasted white space. Formatting and font look professional, and is not a "wall of text" or simply bullet points with no organization. The key message(s) and recommendations are presented to the client, up front, but could be more specific. More detail would be useful to fully describe the process undertaken and how your success was measured. Sections of the Executive Summary should also: restate the original problem statement or question, summarize methods and approach, and provide next steps or use case scenarios. At least one polished visual should be included that summarizes a key message, and has a clear and informative caption.
| C, Underdeveloped | Title page is contains identifying text, including, but not limited to, client name, project name, team name, etc, but is not visually appealing or professionally prepared. The Executive Summary is poorly organized, is overcrowded or has wasted white space. Formatting and font appear as a "wall of text" or bullet points with little logical organization. The key message(s) and recommendations are presented but need to be more focused and emphasized. More detail is needed to fully describe the process undertaken and how your success was measured. Sections of the Executive Summary should also: restate the original problem statement or question, summarize methods and approach, and provide next steps or use case scenarios. At least one visual is included, but it is extraneous to the key message, and/or has an unclear caption explaining it. |
| D, Limited | Title page is missing key information needed to understand the document and is poorly prepared. The executive summary is unfocused, and does not show significant progress made towards the original goal. Displays little to no editing or student engagement with the data analytics cycle and the process of managing and communicating the project tasks. Summary is missing a clear key message and/or recommendation, or other critical sections needed to summarize the work. Visual is missing.| 
| F, No Credit | The title page or executive summary is missing, or consists of disconnected thoughts that are difficult to follow. Reader is unable to discern a key accomplishment, message, or recommendation.|

### Main Report

Describe in technical detail, but also provide plain language that can help your client understand what you did, why you chose it, and how it helps to reach your goal.|	|
|Clearly state any assumptions, constraints, or risks that your plan for data wrangling, analysis, and interpretation contained, that could possibly affect your findings. If you can provide some details or assurance that these risks were unlikely to affect your main result, even better!|	|
|Findings | 15 |
| Fully and accurately interpret the findings from at least two statistical tests that you used on the data. (e.g., for a linear regression, this means R2, P-value, and slope estimate) in the text, or in a nicely formatted table. In addition to the technical details, there should be some plain language that explains the result and the main insight to the client.|	|
| Polished visual (graphic) #1 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable. Appears near where it is described in the text.|	|
| Polished visual (graphic or table) #2 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable. Appears near where it is described in the text.|
| Recommendations | 10 |
| Translate the findings into a detailed set of recommendations and/or continued use of the deliverable(s) for the client.|	|
| Based on your results and your work, communicate your level of confidence in your recommendations, and why your project provides value to your client.|	|

| References | 5 |
| Clear and properly formatted citations (APA) for all supporting material used in the text and in the references section. 5 citations minimum, but more is better.|	|
| Overall Report | 15 | 
| Clarity - Visuals and text follow a clear and consistent format and the report flows well and reads logically from one section to the next. There are no spelling or grammar errors.|	|
| Professionalism - The report contains ABC ( Accurate, Brief, and Clear ) writing. Bullet points and numbering are used with purpose and organization, and are not superfluous.|	|
| Audience and Perspective - The report is clearly written for the client. It clearly links each task and preliminary finding back to the main overarching questions/problems that drive the project as a whole. The document follows a clear organization and narrative throughout.|	|
| Total | 100 | 

It is assumed that any appendix included will be neat and professionally prepared. An appendix that doesn't meet these criteria, or one that is obviously missing when it should be included, will result in a grade reduction. 

### Deliverables and Supporting Materials 

| Rating | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| A, Exceptional | Submitted as a single zipped folder that contains all relevant programs, code, documents, and a README file. Each item in the folder follows clear standard naming practices, and has the appropriate extensions. No corrupted files are included. README file contains text that identifies each item in the folder, what it does, and how it should be read or used ( similar to the last section of the Technical Report ). Additional text may be provided to explain in more detail which items are the most important for the client to pay attention to, and which exist for further detail, or transparency in your process. README file may also contain links to relevant items that are stored on the web (e.g. Dropbox, GitHub, Google Drive, Tableau, etc.). If necessary to your project, one (or more) of the files represent a tutorial or instructions for the client to use the tool and/or dataset(s) you are providing to them. Code files (e.g. your project manager [professor] may find these useful) are well annotated and follow good naming and style practices, such that they may be read, interpreted, and/or used by another person. Dataset(s) included follow tidy data rules, and a basic metadata file is included that helps the client understand the meaning of the rows, columns, variables, types, etc. in the data--particularly necessary if you collected new data or did significant cleaning or re-framing of old data. | 
| B, Satisfactory | Submitted as a single zipped folder that contains all relevant programs, code, documents, and a README file. Each item in the folder follows good naming practices. No corrupted files are included. README file contains text that identifies each item in the folder, what it does, and how it should be read or used. README file may also contain links to relevant items that are stored on the web (e.g. Dropbox, GitHub, Google Drive, Tableau, etc.), but more details would help understand the files. If necessary to your project, a tutorial exists for the client to use the tool and/or dataset(s) you are providing to them, but some additional polish would improve it. Code files (e.g. your project manager [ professor ] may find these useful) are annotated and follow consistent naming practices, but improved style guidelines would aid in being read or used by another person. Dataset(s) included follow tidy data rules, and a basic metadata file is included that helps the client understand the meaning of the rows, columns, variables, types, etc. in the data.| 
| C, Underdeveloped | Submitted as a single zipped folder that contains most of the relevant programs, code, documents, and a README file. The file naming system is unclear or confusing. README file contains text that identifies each item in the folder, and what it does, but details are lacking to know what to focus on or how to use it. README file may also contain links to relevant items that are stored on the web, but more details are needed understand the files. Tutorial is needed, but is either missing or too confusing to be useful. Code files (e.g. your project manager [professor] may find these useful) are not annotated and are difficult to be read or used by another person. Dataset(s) included do not follow tidy data rules, and/or a basic metadata file is needed, but is not included.| 
| D, Limited | Submitted as a set of disconnected files, or is contained in a single zipped folder, but necessary files are obviously missing. README file is disorganized or incomplete. Tutorial is missing. Metadata is missing. Code files are missing, incomplete, or buggy.|
| F, No Credit | Supporting materials are missing or consist of disconnected files with few to no instructions for use. | 

### Final Team Presentation to Client Grading Rubric (10%)

In each area, you will be scored 1-3, on a scale of weak--average--strong.

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Section Preparedness: | All students arrive on time, with 1-page, front only handout, printed (in color if useful) to give to all professor(s) and client(s) at the meeting. They are prepared to begin, and spend a minimal amount of time "setting up".|
| Visual Material: | Clearly summarizes and communicates the most important items for the client to know, or refer to during the final presentation. Key recommendations/results are clear. The handout is professionally prepared and is not crowded, nor does it contain excess white space. There is one graphic or table on the handout, clearly printed and professionally prepared.|
| Clarity: | The presentation had a clear organization, and was easy to follow across the different presenters and sections. The main message and how it provided value to the client was easy to discern from the presentation.|
| Knowledge: | Demonstrated an understanding of the subject, the analytical tools used (computational and statistical), critical thinking skills, and of the feasibility of your recommendations. Use of language and examples: Helped others to understand the material, by using plain language and examples/explanations that a listener unfamiliar with your dataset or subject could understand. Audience : The talk was clearly aimed for the main audience member, the client. The main focus was on the key messages and recommendations useful to the client, and technical pieces were explained in clear, plain, language, to be easily understood by the main client(s).|
| Engagement: | Engaged the audience and kept interest (this could include things like, made eye contact, looked up from notes, used an expressive voice, and/or used visuals, handouts, drawing on the board, or hand gestures to help explain).|
| Time Management: | Demonstrated good time management skills by staying within the time limit and each team member presenting their section in a clear and concise manner, and not rambling, nor rushing through the material. Team members presented for a (roughly) equivalent amount of time. Good use of discussion or Q&A time to share the floor with your client's excitement, curiosity, or concerns. Oral Presentation: Each presenter spoke clearly and loudly enough to be heard and understood. Speakers avoided distracting behaviors, like shifting, pacing, or unnecessarily adjusting clothing, hair. Speakers didn't speak too fast, & during discussion did not talk over or interrupt teammates or clients. |
| Visual Presentation: | Visual aids (graphs, charts, photos, etc) helped increase engagement and understanding of the subject matter and project approach. All visuals presented were at high enough resolution to be readable, without appearing blurry or stretched, and citations were given if the images were not created by the presenter. Reaction and alertness: Demonstrated an ability to "quick thinking in the moment" to respond clearly and well to unexpected questions or events, or to offered advice or feedback from your client. |
| Client-Team interaction: | Feedback from your client suggests that the meeting was professionally conducted and that they were satisfied with your interaction and written/oral bid presentation.|
| Client-Team satisfaction: | Feedback from your client suggests that they were satisfied with your preparation, domain research and plan.|
| Total: | Unless there are strong extenuating circumstances communicated to the professor (an emergency), failing to be on time or an active participant in the final presentation will result in an individual's grade being reduced. Failing to attend the meeting will result in a zero for that individual on this portion of the final.|
