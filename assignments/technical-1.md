# Technical Progress Report I

This is a team assignment worth 10% of your overall course grade. It should be submitted to the professor and to your client (in the same email) no later than 5 pm on Friday, October 2.

The main goal of the progress report is to demonstrate visibility and transparency to your client. You need to make sure they understand how the project is progressing and have the opportunity for input at critical checkpoints along the way. To do this, you will need to communicate clearly, concisely, and effectively, and be prepared to use the progress report as the basis of a discussion to revamp or clarify aspects of your project.

The writing and appearance of your report should be professional. This means the writing is ABC - accurate, brief, and concise - and the report should have a cover page (this may be very similar to your initial cover pages for the project bid). That said, concrete details, visualizations, issues, etc. ... can and should be part of this check-in, but explained and contextualized in ways apropos to the audience. Your client may choose to print the document or read it online, but to be safe, make sure that if you use color, there are other formatting or design elements that still make it readable if the document were to be printed in black and white. You may choose to use indentation, bullet points, numbering, page breaks, flow charts, or other visual cues in parts of your report to enumerate items or set main ideas apart, but be cautious of overusing these elements, or using them in an attempt to "take up space". 

At this stage, I will also ask for individual feedback on the teamwork process (Google form will be sent separately around the due date). No team member can get a "better" grade than the team's Progress Report as it is handed in. However, in cases of documented poor collaboration or free riding, an individual team member could receive a lower grade than their teammates. In general, on the form, consistent ratings of 4-5 are good, 3's warrant a chat with the professor, and 1-2's will result in a serious 1-on-1 discussion and grade reduction. If you would like to talk in person about any aspect of the team or client dynamic, my door is open, and we can speak confidentially, if you prefer.

## Section Overview:

### 1. Cover Page

This may include your consulting team name and contact info, your client's name and/or
the project's name, and some graphic or formatting that sets it apart from any other
"typical" college essay. I recommend googling around for some inspiration or examples,
and checking in with your instructors if you aren't sure.

### 2. Executive Summary

This is designed to serve the person who may not intend to read the entire report. In 1
page, it should state the main points from each below section, and emphasize the
accomplishments and findings so far, the schedule of the work, any changes to schedule
or provisions needed, and the work to be done. In theory, your point person could read
only this page, and understand your accomplishments, and gain some advice on a
decision or course of action. You may choose to use Red Yellow Green task status, or
something else, or not, as a quick way to help your client match tasks and milestones to
projected schedule.

### 3. Technical Progress Report (the main part of the report)

This section should essentially be an update on the information presented in your initial
project bid and is the "meat" of your progress report. Exact wording and ordering of the
information or subheaders is up to you, but you should hit on these main points, in a clear
and logical manner:

1. Task accomplishments: What tasks have you accomplished so far? How did you do them? What tools/software did you use?
2. Tasks to be performed: What tasks still remain? What is your schedule for accomplishing them? Are you behind or ahead of schedule (on some or all tasks)? Why? Do you have a plan for getting back on schedule?
3. Schedule and provisions: Do you need to make adjustments to your timeline or expected deliverables? Why? What will you do instead? What is your new timeline? Do you need to update your risks or assumptions? What if you need to call out your client for something you're unsatisfied with - Speaking the kind truth ? How will you mitigate these changes?
4. Preliminary findings: What are your findings so far? What recommendations do
you have so far for the client? Do you have any new concerns that may cause you
to revisit the scope of your project?
5. Visuals: You should use at least 2 visuals in your report. Each graphic or table should
have a clear caption, and should be numbered in some way that you also use to
reference it in the text (Table 1 or Figure 3). Used well, visuals can reinforce the main
points of the text and help teach your client about their data or the analysis you've been
working on. Ideally, you should place your visual close to the point in the text where it is
referred. In the text and/or in the caption, tell your reader what you want them to see and
how you read or interpret the graphic. Visuals should complement, not replace, what is
communicated in the text.

### 4. Summary Conclusions

The final section pulls the progress report together, offers words of assurance to the
client, and the next steps (or questions) that need to be addressed to continue the work.
Here, you should restate your main accomplishments and summarize your findings up to
this point, and what your end goal will be.

### 5. References

APA citation style. You must keep track of all the sources that your team used in the
report. In the text of your report you must cite sources whenever you use ideas or data
generated by someone else, even if you do not quote them directly.

### 6. Appendices

Depending on the nature of your team's tasks, an appendix may or may not be useful.
The appendix does not count towards your total expected length. Material that could be
included in an appendix would be statistical readouts, copies of surveys or questionnaires, reprints or excerpts of helpful articles. ... Don't be tempted to overdo the appendix; the idea is to provide useful extra information that your client would really want to see, and if it's too big, they might not look at it at all! If you include an appendix, you should reference it somewhere within the main text of your report ( See Appendix ).

## Formatting Guidelines 

- 4-5 pages long (not counting visuals, tables, cover page, references, or appendices)
- 1.15 spaced (default in a Google doc)
- Standard font (Times, Arial, Calibri, etc.)
- Standard text size (no smaller than 10, no larger than 12).

## Grading 

I will use the following rubric to assess this assignment. 

| Item 			| Points	| 
| --- | --- |
| __Cover Page__ 	| __10__		| 
| Contains identifying text, including, but not limited to, client name, project name, team name, etc. In other words, it is clear what the document is, from the cover page. Cover page has some visual element to it, and appears professional and polished. It does not look like a "school assignment" and is not overcrowded.|
| __Executive Summary__ 	| __10__	| 
| Text, bullet points, and/or graphics all fit neatly onto 1 page without overcrowding, or wasted white space. |
| Provides a high level overview of the main accomplishments, current schedule (on track, behind, or ahead), suggested changes to the schedule or provisions needed, and the work to be done. |
| __Technical Progress Report__ | __50__	| 
| Identify and describe the accomplishments so far. These should be clear and specific, and in sufficient detail to describe the process undertaken and how your success is measured.|
| Identify and describe the remaining tasks for your project. These should be specific.|
| Provide details for what software or tools you plan to use to accomplish each of your remaining tasks.|
| Identify one or more statistical tests you will use for conducting a quantitative analysis of the data. Describe in some technical detail, but in a way that your client can also understand.|
| Based on the schedule you provided in the project bid, are you on track, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule? Be specific. For example, you may be ahead of schedule in one
area, but behind schedule on another task. Clearly state any updates or changes to your project's plan.|
| If you are not on schedule, state how your timeline has changed and if/how this affects your plan for the end of the semester. Do you need to request provisions/meetings/etc. from your client that were not previously requested? Are you aware of any new risks or assumptions that you didn't know before?|
| Describe what you have learned from the first steps of data cleaning and data exploration.
Describe your preliminary findings or recommendations to the client. It is OK to make it clear here, that these are preliminary and may be subject to change.|
| Polished visual (graphic or table) #1 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable.|
| Polished visual (graphic or table) #2 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable.|
| __Summary Conclusions__ | __10__ |
| Re-state your main accomplishments and summarize your findings up to this point, and remind your client what your end goal will be.|
| Assurance and confidence building - communicates to your client that you are knowledgeable, you have a reasonable plan, and their best interests are the focus of your design.|
| __References__ | __5__ |
| Clear and properly formatted citations (APA) for all supporting material used in the review text and in the references section.|
| __Appendices__ | __5__ |
| If appendices are used, they are professionally presented and concise, and contain items that clearly complement the main report, without overburdening the client with details. |
| __Overall Report__ | __10__ |
| Clarity - Visuals and text follow a clear and consistent format and the report flows well and reads logically from one section to the next. There are no spelling or grammar errors.|
| Professionalism - The report contains concise and precise writing. Bullet points and numbering are used with purpose, and not superfluous.|
