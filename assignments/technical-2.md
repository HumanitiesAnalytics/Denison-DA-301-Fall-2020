# Technical Progress Report II


This is a team assignment worth 10% of your overall course grade. It should be emailed to the client and instructor (at the same time) by the end of the day on Friday, October 23. As this is your second progress report, the main goal is to update your client on the past month's accomplishments and provide the opportunity for input on any changes or new insights thus far. Use the guidelines for professional writing we discussed in class to communicate accurately, briefly, and clearly . I would also like you to present early models and an attempt to translate those in visuals and prose. You want to do this to get early feedback on strategies and especially how you are communicating them (i.e., clearly, fairly, and in a way that is appropriate and meaningful to the client given their expertise). 

The writing and appearance of your report should be professional. This means the writing is
clear and concise and the report should have a cover page. Your client may choose to print the document or read it online, but to be safe, make sure that if you use color, there is other formatting or design elements that still make it readable if the document were to be printed in black and white. You may choose to use indentation, bullet points, numbering, page breaks, flow charts, or other visual cues in parts of your report to enumerate items or set main ideas apart, but be cautious of overusing these elements, or using them in an attempt to "take up space." Conversely, try to avoid the "wall of text" style of report, which is difficult to scan for details.

At this stage, I will again ask for individual feedback on the teamwork process. No team member can get a "better" grade than the team's Progress Report as it is handed in. However, in cases of documented poor collaboration or free riding, an individual team member could receive a lower grade than their teammates. I am aware that sometimes a team member wants simply to be heard regarding a frustration with an interaction, and other times they want an active resolution. If you are seeking a resolution, you and/or your team will need to take the additional first step of contacting and meeting with me to discuss a path forward for better division of work, communication, and/or conflict mediation, that can preserve your working relationship. The report should contain the sections outlined in the first Progress Report assignment. It should build on the first progress report (so you don't need to start from scratch), but should demonstrate a significant push forward.

1. Cover Page
2. Executive Summary
3. Technical Progress Report (+ 2 new visuals and at least 1 statistical test)
4. Summary or Conclusions
5. References
6. Appendices (Optional; if included, it is the last part of the report)

## Formatting Guidelines 

- 3-6 pages long (not counting visuals, tables, cover page, references, or appendices)
- 1.15 spaced (default in a Google doc)
- Standard font (Times, Arial, Calibri, etc.)
- Standard text size (no smaller than 10, no larger than 12).

## Grading 

I will use the following rubric to assess this assignment. 


| Item 			| Points	| 
| --- | --- |
| __Cover Page__ 	| __10__		| 
| Contains identifying text, including, but not limited to, client name, project name, team name, etc. In other words, it is clear what the document is, from the cover page. Cover page has some visual element to it, and appears professional and polished. It does not look like a "school assignment" and is not overcrowded.|
| __Executive Summary__ 	| __10__	| 
| Text, bullet points, and/or graphics all fit neatly onto 1 page without overcrowding, or wasted white space. |
| Provides a high level overview of the main accomplishments, current schedule (on track, behind, or ahead), suggested changes to the schedule or provisions needed, and the work to be done. |
| __Technical Progress Report__ | __50__	| 
| Identify and describe the accomplishments so far. These should be clear and specific, and in sufficient detail to describe the process undertaken and how your success is measured.|
| Identify and describe the remaining tasks for your project. These should be specific.|
| Provide details for what software or tools you plan to use to accomplish each of your remaining tasks.|
| Identify one or more statistical tests you will use for conducting a quantitative analysis of the data. Describe in some technical detail, but in a way that your client can also understand.|
| Based on the schedule you provided in the project bid, are you on track, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule? Be specific. For example, you may be ahead of schedule in one
area, but behind schedule on another task. Clearly state any updates or changes to your project's plan.|
| If you are not on schedule, state how your timeline has changed and if/how this affects your plan for the end of the semester. Do you need to request provisions/meetings/etc. from your client that were not previously requested? Are you aware of any new risks or assumptions that you didn't know before?|
| Describe what you have learned from the first steps of data cleaning and data exploration.
Describe your preliminary findings or recommendations to the client. It is OK to make it clear here, that these are preliminary and may be subject to change.|
| Polished visual (graphic or table) #1 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable.|
| Polished visual (graphic or table) #2 that supports the text, with a clear and concise descriptive caption. If printed in black & white, it would still be readable.|
| __Summary Conclusions__ | __10__ |
| Re-state your main accomplishments and summarize your findings up to this point, and remind your client what your end goal will be.|
| Assurance and confidence building - communicates to your client that you are knowledgeable, you have a reasonable plan, and their best interests are the focus of your design.|
| __References__ | __5__ |
| Clear and properly formatted citations (APA) for all supporting material used in the review text and in the references section.|
| __Appendices__ | __5__ |
| If appendices are used, they are professionally presented and concise, and contain items that clearly complement the main report, without overburdening the client with details. |
| __Overall Report__ | __10__ |
| Clarity - Visuals and text follow a clear and consistent format and the report flows well and reads logically from one section to the next. There are no spelling or grammar errors.|
| Professionalism - The report contains concise and precise writing. Bullet points and numbering are used with purpose, and not superfluous.| 

__Note__: Please don't forget to fill out your team/self assessment when it is sent out. A missing assessment means a 5% reduction in an individual's grade, i.e. 5 points lower than the team's Technical Progress Report grade.
