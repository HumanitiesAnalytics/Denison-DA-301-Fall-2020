# Individual Data Visualization Assignment

This is an individual assignment that counts for 5% of your grade for the course. It is due by class time on Wednesday, October 14, 2020. The goal of the assignment is to use a strategy of iteration and revision to nudge your data visualizations/graphics toward being more professional (publication quality) by doing two or more of the following:

1. Harmonizing design elements with distinctive (non-template) fonts, colors, backgrounds, alignments, etc.
2. Developing a "design theme" of your own that you can use for a set of visualizations in a report, poster, or other deliverable.
3. Combining multiple visualizations into a dashboard or infographic in Photoshop, Tableau, etc.
4. Using less commonly employed data visualization types such as treemaps, network diagrams, bubble plots, etc. 

For the assignment, each student should make one visualization. 

For the assignment, each student should make one polished visualization or composite. Visualizations should stand on their own, so other than prose that naturally
goes in a visual (i.e., title, axis labels, source(s), a short caption, etc...) all that you will submit is the final visualization. While you may want to use data related to your project in order to promote synergy with this task, you are free to use any publicly, and ethically available data set that advances your goals. In fact, you may want to eventually use your viz as a public facing post which might preclude using some client data/results. However this is completely your call. Under no circumstances should you use or recycle a visualisation from another class.

You have two options or tracks for this assignment:

## Option 1: 

A multi-viz dashboard or infographic out of 2-3 simpler visualizations
 
## Option 2: 

A less commonly used visualization type from the list below. If you choose this option, bear in mind that you will need to find or create a dataset that will work with your data visualization. 

For either option, your visualization should be very well polished, with a clear title on top and a fully developed caption below the graphic. The data labels should be human readable, and the any axis scales, legends, etc. should be polished as well. Further, you should choose distinctive design elements such as fonts, colors, backgrounds, alignments, etc., that make your visualization look different than the default template in whatever tool or library you are using. You can do all of this with code, or you can save your image and edit it in Photoshop if you know how. Your goal is to begin to establish the elements of a "design theme" that would work for multiple visualizations.

## Turning it In

Turn in your work (one file) using your individual GDrive folders. JPG or PNG are the preferred file formats.
